This project demonstrates real-time tracking of multiple colored objects (blue, green, and red) using OpenCV in Python. The program captures video from the default camera, processes each frame to detect specified colors, and draws bounding boxes around the detected objects.

## Features

- **Real-time object tracking**: Tracks blue, green, and red colored objects in a video feed.
- **Multiple color detection**: Detects and tracks more than one color simultaneously.
- **Bounding box display**: Draws rectangles around detected objects in the original video feed.
- **Mask visualization**: Displays binary masks for color detection and the result of the color filtering.
